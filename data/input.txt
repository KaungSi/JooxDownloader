# (actual working Song IDs) 
# 
# These are all ok
# The thing you need is in between song/ and /lyric
# other stuff is cut off anyways
# empty lines are also ignored
# Now just run boot.sh to download ALL THE MUSIC
# 
# Leave some time between each download so they will not know
# and download just 20 per batch or they would notice something strange
# 
# Also, Don't put # in front of the line, your link will not be downloaded
# kbye
