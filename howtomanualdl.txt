here's it's song id: lFOQh6dEsv6oJ7Gbqxn_MQ==
where's it at: http://music.sanook.com/music/song/<song id is here>/lyric/

2.now put it after this

ex. : http://api.joox.com/web-fcgi-bin/web_get_songinfo?songid=lFOQh6dEsv6oJ7Gbqxn_MQ==

3.now open the link in a browser or download the link
you will get a file with stuff in it
what you should find (a part of it): MusicInfoCallback({"album_url":"<some jpg link>","code":<?>,"country":"<country>","encodeSongId":"<here's the song id again>","express_domain":"<blahblahblah...

4.find this
choose: m4aUrl mp3Url r192Url r320Url
m4aUrl : m4a file, fallback choice when no other links is present (used by JD)
mp3Url : mp3 file at some bitrate i didn't check
r192Url: m4a file @ 192kbps
r320Url: mp3 file @ 320kbps (used by JD)

find "<ur choice>":"
ex. "m4aUrl":"http://stream.music.joox.com/C100001c0yAz0jqVIc.m4a?fromtag=38"
there's your ticket straight to the file
be quick, it'll forbid your access if your too slow

5.dl that stuff
now that you find the url
paste that into your browser to download it or your download manager
the song information is in the metadata
so to know what is that song, find a metadata viewer
or copy them to a windows machine near you
or open a samba share and view the file through lan (note: only short name show metadata, long name don't metadata)
